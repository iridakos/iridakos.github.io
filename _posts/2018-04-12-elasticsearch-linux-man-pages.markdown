In this post we are going to play around with full text searching Linux man pages using Elasticsearch.

## The idea

We will:

1. setup an **Elasticsearch** instance locally
2. create an index for the data
3. feed the index with the man pages of the OS
4. create a search method for full text searching
5. full text search the man pages

## The code

I have gathered the code snippets you will find here in a script called [`elman`](https://github.com/iridakos/elman) and it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iridakos/elman) so after reading this post to get the idea, you can experiment by modifying it as you please.

Let's start.

## Prerequisites

### Ruby
You should have ruby installed on your system. I use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to manage multiple ruby versions installed on my system. If you want to go with that too, you can find instructions for installing the tool in its [homepage](https://rvm.io/) and for installing ruby versions (a.k.a. rubies) the [related documentation page](https://rvm.io/rubies/installing).

This tutorial is using **Ruby 2.4.2**. You can check yours using: `ruby --version` or via RVM with `rvm list`.

### Elasticsearch

Providing instructions for installing Elasticsearch is out of this post's scope. I recommend visiting the tool's related [documenation site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).

After the installation, just make sure to start the service if it's not started.

You can check that with `curl http://localhost:9200`.

It should give something like:

```javascript
{
  "name" : "asdfasdf",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "asasdfdf-as",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.0.0",
    "build_hash" : "asdf",
    "build_date" : "2017-11-10T18:41:22.859Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.0.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

As you can see, we will use elasticsearch **version 6.0.0** in this tutorial.

## Hands on

We will be working in the awesome Ruby interactive shell (`irb`) but before starting it there's a gem we need to install.

### The elasticsearch gem

The [`elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby) gem is the official library provided by Elastic to interact with Elasticsearch instances in Ruby.

Install the gem and its dependencies use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gem install elasticsearch
```

### Ruby interactive shell

Start the Ruby interactive shell with:

```bash
irb
```

Load the Elasticsearch library we previously installed with:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch'
```

You should see something like the following:
```ruby
>> require 'elasticsearch'
=> true
>>
```

From now on, in our session we can use the gem's provided classes and modules to interact with Elasticsearch.

### Creating the client

We have to create an `Elasticsearch::Client` instance through which we will execute commands on the index.
In irb type:
```ruby
@client = Elasticsearch::Client.new host: 'localhost', port: '9200'
```

Check the cluster's health to make sure everything is right:
```ruby
client.cluster.health
=> {"cluster_name"=>"elasticsearch", "status"=>"yellow", "timed_out"=>false, "number_of_nodes"=>1, "number_of_data_nodes"=>1, "active_primary_shards"=>10, "active_shards"=>10, "relocating_shards"=>0, "initializing_shards"=>0, "unassigned_shards"=>10, "delayed_unassigned_shards"=>0, "number_of_pending_tasks"=>0, "number_of_in_flight_fetch"=>0, "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis"=>0, "active_shards_percent_as_number"=>50.0}
```

Make sure that the `status` from the output hash is not `red`.

### Creating the index

Let's name the index `elastic_manpages` and set that it is going to have three properties:

1. **command**: the Linux command (even though there are man pages for other stuff like `time.conf` which is a configuration file)

2. **description**: the short description provided in the top of the man page, in the `NAME` section

3. **manpage**: the corresponding man page

Create the index with the following command:

```ruby
@client.indices.create   index: 'elastic_manpages',
                         body: {
                           mappings: {
                             document: {
                               properties: {
                                 command: {
                                   type: :text
                                 },
                                 description: {
                                   type: :text,
                                   analyzer: :english
                                 },
                                 manpage: {
                                   type: :text,
                                   analyzer: :english
                                 }
                               }
                             }
                           }
                         }
```

As you can see, we assigned the **english analyzer** to the `description` and `manpage` properties.

Why? Quoting the documentation on [Language analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/analysis-intro.html):

> They are able to take the peculiarities of the specified language into account. For instance, the english analyzer comes with a set of English stopwords (common words like and or the that donâ€™t have much impact on relevance), which it removes. This analyzer also is able to stem English words because it understands the rules of English grammar.

After typing the command, you should get a response like this one:

```ruby
=> {"acknowledged"=>true, "shards_acknowledged"=>true, "index"=>"elastic_manpages"}
```

### Indexing the man pages

Time to index the man pages. We are going to use the `apropos` command to list all entries of the **mandb**.

```ruby
all_pages = `apropos .`.split "\n"
```

The `all_pages` variable now contains a list of all man entries in the following format:

```bash
erb (1)              - Ruby Templating
```

**Note**: the `(1)` part above defines [what section of the manual the page](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3586/what-do-the-numbers-in-a-man-page-mean) is from.

For each entry of this list, we need to:

1. export the command and the description
2. retrieve the man page for each command
3. index a new document mapping the values of the previous items to the appropriate properties.

To split the raw `apropos` entry to the desired field, we will use the following regex:

```ruby
/(.*)\s\(\d*.*\)\s*-\s*(.*)/
```

You can check that is working on [Rubular](http://rubular.com/r/ZKL45vbJvU).

Back in irb:

```ruby
apropos_regex = /(.*)\s\(\d*.*\)\s*-\s*(.*)/
all_pages.each do |line|
  matches = apropos_regex.match line
  command = matches[1]
  description = matches[2]
  manpage = `man #{command}`

  @client.index index: 'elastic_manpages',
                type: :document,
                body: {
                  command: command,
                  description: description,
                  manpage: manpage
                }
end
```

It will take some time depending on your hardware and the amount of man pages on your OS. Wait for it to end. During the process of indexing you might see some warnings for some pages but don't worry, the process will complete after all and we don't care that much about them not being indexed correctly for the purpose of this tutorial.

### Creating the search method

Now will create a method for full text searching so that we can execute it more than once to search.

In irb:

```ruby
def search(term)
  result = @client.search  index: 'elastic_manpages',
                           size: 10,
                           body: {
                             query: {
                               multi_match: {
                                 query: term,
                                 type: :cross_fields,
                                 fields: ['command', 'description^3', 'manpage^3'],
                                 operator: :or,
                                 tie_breaker: 1.0,
                                 cutoff_frequency: 0.1
                               }
                             }
                           }

  result['hits']['hits'].map{ |hit| { command: hit['_source']['command'],
                                      description: hit['_source']['description'],
                                      manpage: hit['_source']['manpage'] } }
end
```

#### Notes on the search definition

1. `size: 10`: set the size of the results to be 10
2. `multi_match`: because we want to search on multiple fields (`command`, `description`, `manpage`)
3. `type: :cross_fields`: The cross_fields type is particularly useful with structured documents where multiple fields should match (read more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-cross-fields))
4. `tie_breaker`: add the scores for each term of the query (read more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#_literal_tie_breaker_literal))
5. `cutoff_frequency`: it prevents scoring / iterating high frequency terms and only takes the terms into account if a more significant / lower frequency term matches a document (read more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html#query-dsl-match-query-cutoff))

### Play time!
