## Introduction
I decided to write a series of tutorials about Elasticsearch aggregations.
In this first post of the series, we are going to deal with the **bucket aggregations** that allow us to implement faceted navigation.

### What is Elasticsearch
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is an opensource JSON-based search engine that allows us to search indexed data quickly and with options that are not provided by classic data stores.

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.
> <cite>-- <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">official Elasticsearch product page</a></cite>

### What is Kibana

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is a tool mainly allowing visualization of Elasticsearch data. We will use Kibana because it also provides a very convenient way for writing and executing queries (with autocomplete).

> Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so you can do anything from learning why you're getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on your quarterly numbers.
> <cite>-- <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">official Kibana product page</a></cite>

### What are Elasticsearch bucket aggregations

Before familiarizing myself with the term **aggregations** in the Elasticsearch world, what I was actually trying to learn was how to implement the widely known feature of **facets** for my indexed data.

Chances are that you know about facets, you have seen it in many sites. They are usually placed as a sidebar in search results landing pages and they are rendered as links or checkboxes that act as filters to help you narrow the results based on their properties.

A section of Elasticsearch's [aggregations framework](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) named **bucket aggregations** provides the functionality we need to implement a faceted navigation.

> Bucket aggregations donâ€™t calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines whether or not a document in the current context "falls" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the bucket aggregations also compute and return the number of documents that "fell into" each bucket.

## Prerequisites

In order to be able to execute the tutorial's commands and queries, you must first:

### Install Elasticsearch (duh)

Providing instructions for installing Elasticsearch is out of scope. I recommend visiting the product's related [documenation site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html). After the installation, just make sure to start the service if it's not started. You can check that with
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

It should give something like:

```javascript
{
  "name" : "blabla",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "blabla",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.4.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "04711c2",
    "build_date" : "2018-09-26T13:34:09.098244Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.4.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

As you can see, we will use Elasticsearch **version 6.4.2** in this tutorial.

### Install Kibana

I recommend following the [official instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/install.html) for installing kibana at your machine's OS. I followed [this guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/deb.html) for installing the product via a repository in Ubuntu.

Start the kibana service and navigate to its home page at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601). We will heavily use the **Dev Tools** which is a powerful console talking to the Elasticsearch engine.

![Kibana Dev tools]({{site.url}}/assets/images/posts/elasticsearch-bucket-aggregations/01-kibana-welcome.png)

## What is it going to be covered

We are going to deal with:

- Terms aggregations
- Sub-aggregations
- Nested and reverse nested aggregations
- Global aggregations

Don't be afraid, everything will become very clear once we start playing with the data.

## Hands on

Let the fun begin.

### The model

Suppose that we want to implement a web application for city pet registrations.
We will define the following entities:

* **City office**: a city pet registration office
  * **city**: the city in which the office is located
  * **office type**: the type of the office (central, district)
* **Citizen**: a citizen with registered pets
  * **occupation**: the occupation of the citizen
  * **age**: the age of the citizen
* **Pet**: a citizen's pet
  * **kind**: the kind of the pet (cat, dog etc)
  * **name**: the name of the pet
  * **age**: the age of the pet

Our entities relations are:

* One _city office_ **has many** _citizens_
* One _citizen_ **has many** registered pets

### Prepare the data

Before starting explaining the aggregations, we first have to create the index to store our data and then we have to feed this index with sample data.

#### Create the index

Navigate to Kibana's Dev Tools page and execute the following request:

```json
PUT city_offices
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "city": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
        "office_type": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
        "citizens": {
          "type": "nested",
          "properties": {
            "occupation": {
              "type": "keyword"
            },
            "age": {
              "type": "integer"
            },
            "pets": {
              "type": "nested",
              "properties": {
                "kind": {
                  "type": "keyword"
                  },
                "name": {
                  "type": "keyword"
                },
                "age": {
                  "type": "integer"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the output section, you should see:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "city_offices"
}
```

We created an index with name `city_offices` with the [aforementioned properties](#the-model).

**Important note**: we chose to define the entity relations as **nested objects**. Why?

> The nested type is a specialized version of the object datatype that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other ... Lucene has no concept of inner objects, so Elasticsearch flattens object hierarchies into a simple list of field names and values
> <cite>-- [official elasticsearch nested datatype reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html)</cite>

I will explain this with an example.

Suppose we had a city office with two citizens. One **35** year old **Dentist** and one 30 year old Developer.
If we used the **object** datatype, Elasticsearch would merge all sub-properties of the entity relation resulting to something like this:
```json
{
  "citizens": {
    "occupation": ["Dentist", "Developer"],
    "age": ["35", "30"]
  }
}
```
Thus, if we wanted to search the index for offices that have a **Dentist** citizen with age **30**, this document would fulfill the criteria even though the Dentist is 35 years old.

Mapping the relation as **nested** overcomes this problem since

> Internally, nested objects index each object in the array as a separate hidden document, meaning that each nested object can be queried independently of the others
> <cite>-- [official elasticsearch nested datatype reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html#_using_literal_nested_literal_fields_for_arrays_of_objects)</cite>

#### Feed sample data

I have created some sample data with random cities, occupations, pet names etc. You can find it at this tutorial's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/iridakos/iridakos-posts/tree/master/2018-09-22-elasticsearch-bucket-aggregations).

Download the file `sample-data.json` and from within the download folder execute:

```bash
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -XPOST http://localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary "@sample-data.json"; echo
```

**Note**: The data were generated with [this ruby script](https://github.com/iridakos/iridakos-posts/blob/master/2018-09-22-elasticsearch-bucket-aggregations/generate-random-data.rb). You can alter it as you please and execute it to produce your desired sample data json file.

That's it. Aggregations time.

### Aggregation request format

All aggregation queries are embedded in search requests.

```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{
  "query": { ... },
  "aggs": {
    "<aggregation name>": {
      "<aggregation type>": { <aggregation properties> }
    }
  }
}
```

where:
* **aggregation name**: is the name we give to our aggregation. This is required in order to be able to parse the search response afterwards and locate the specific aggregation results (you will understand this better after we execute the first aggregation request).
* **aggregation type**: is the type of the aggregation we want to execute. You can browse all available aggregations provided by Elasticsearch [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html).
* **aggregation properties**: are the available properties specific to the aggregation type.

### Terms aggregations

We will use the [Terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html) aggregation in order to find out how many different values our documents have in a specific field.

Navigate to Kibana's Dev Tools section and in the console (left section of the page) type the following:

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": { "field": "city" }
    }
  }
}
```

Following the syntax described in the [Aggregation request format](#aggregation-request-format) section above
* we are searching in the `city_offices` index
* we are requesting an aggregation of type `terms`
* we specify that we are interested in the different values of the field `city`

Now execute the request by pressing the *play* <i class="text-success fa fa-play icon-in-text"></i> link that you should be seeing given that the query you typed is focused.

Voila!

```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 113,
    "max_score": 1,
    "hits": [
      {
        ...
      }
    ]
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "cities": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 37,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "Amsterdam",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "London",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Oslo",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Paris",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "San Francisco",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Tokyo",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Athens",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Barcelona",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Chicago",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Madrid",
          "doc_count": 7
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Since we are executing a search request, the response contains the `hits` attribute with all the results matching our query (in this case all documents since we didn't add a query). It also contains though another attribute named **`aggregations`** and that's where our aggregation results fall under.

Inside the `aggregations` you can see our `cities` aggregation and that's why it is required to name the aggregations you define.

Before explaining the weird `sum_other_doc_count` *37* value, let's first examine the `buckets`.

There's our different values for the `city` field of the city offices. "Human reading" the values, we have 8 offices in Amsterdam, London, Oslo, Paris, San Francisco and Tokyo, 7 offices in Athens, Barcelona, Chicago and Madrid.

The total of these offices is 76 but the search response says we have 113. Let's subtract the bucket's office total from the actual total offices: `(113 - 76 = 37) == sum_other_doc_count`. That's right. Explanation: the aggregation we defined has another property named **`size`** which has a default value of *10*. Since we didn't define another value, Elasticsearch limited the buckets to the top 10 different city values based on their occurrences in the index. **37 are the documents whose cities are not listed in the buckets and NOT the number of the unlisted cities**.

Let's change the size to 50 (hoping that we don't have offices in more than 50 cities).

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Hint:** In addition to defining the aggregation's size, I also set in the top level query the size to **0** so that I can browse the response faster since the *hits* attribute will be empty.

Execute again.

```json
{
  "took": 1,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 113,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "cities": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "Amsterdam",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "London",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Oslo",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Paris",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "San Francisco",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Tokyo",
          "doc_count": 8
        },
        {
          "key": "Athens",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Barcelona",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Chicago",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Madrid",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "New York",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Warsaw",
          "doc_count": 7
        },
        {
          "key": "Berlin",
          "doc_count": 6
        },
        {
          "key": "Budapest",
          "doc_count": 6
        },
        {
          "key": "Melbourne",
          "doc_count": 6
        },
        {
          "key": "Prague",
          "doc_count": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Perfect. The previously missed cities are now fetched and the `sum_other_doc_count`'s **0** value confirms that we haven't left any document outside the aggregation.

Let's add another aggregation for the offices, this time for their type.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      }
    },
    "office_types": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "office_type"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We defined another `terms` aggregation named `office_types` and kept the default bucket size since we know that we don't have more than 10 distinct office types.

```json
{
  "took": 1,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 113,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "cities": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        ...
      ]
    },
    "office_types": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "primary",
          "doc_count": 57
        },
        {
          "key": "secondary",
          "doc_count": 56
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

So, we have *57* primary and *56* secondary offices and *0* offices left outside the aggregation's buckets.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <div class="alert-heading"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Important note</div>
  If we do define a <strong>search query</strong> along with the aggregations definition, then <strong>the aggregations will be applied to the subset of the documents that match the search query</strong>.
</div>

For example, if we want to see how many different office types are in Athens, we can specify the appropriate search query without altering the aggregations' one.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "city": {
        "value": "Athens"
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      }
    },
    "office_types": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "office_type",
        "size": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Execute and...

```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 7,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "cities": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "Athens",
          "doc_count": 7
        }
      ]
    },
    "office_types": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "secondary",
          "doc_count": 5
        },
        {
          "key": "primary",
          "doc_count": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

We have *5* secondary and *2* primary offices in *Athens*.

What if we wanted to have **this information for all cities without having to limit the search's results**? In other words, what if we wanted to present the facets like this:

#### Sub-bucket aggregations

The **Terms** aggregations (and other type of aggregations) allow the definition of sub-aggregations. The sub-aggregations are executed in the documents belonging to the bucket of the parent aggregation. It's like asking: Give me the different cities. Ok, now give me for each one how many office types it has.

The syntax of sub-aggregations is pretty straight forward.

```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{
  "query": { ... },
  "aggs": {
    "<aggregation name>": {
      "<aggregation type>": { <aggregation properties> },
      "aggs": {
        "<sub-aggregation name>": {
          "<sub-aggregation type>": { <sub-aggregation properties> }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Applying the above in our case, all we have to do is to define the search request as follows:

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      },
      "aggs": {
        "office_types": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "office_type"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "office_types": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "office_type",
        "size": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

          "key": "secondary",
          "doc_count": 56
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If we wanted to retrieve even more sub-results for another property of the city offices (for example building type), we could add a sub-aggregation inside the already defined *office_types* sub-aggregation of the *cities* aggregation.

Awesome. Time to play with the pets.

### Nested aggregations

As previously mentioned, we defined the city office's relations as `nested` objects. In order to perform aggregations on these relations we have to follow another approach, the [Nested aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-nested-aggregation.html).

> A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating nested documents.
> <cite>-- [official Elasticsearch Nested Aggregation reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-nested-aggregation.html)</cite>

Syntax:

```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{

  "aggs" : {
    "<aggregation-name>" : {
      "nested" : {
        "path" : "<nested-object-path>"
      },
      "aggs" : {
        "<nested-aggregation-name>": {
          "<aggregation-type>" : { <aggregation-properties> }  
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where **nested-object-path** is the navigation path of the desired object in the root document. For example, if we want aggregations for the **citizens** we will set this property to `citizens`. If we wanted aggregations for the pets, we will set this property to `citizens.pets`.

Let's see how we can breakdown the number of citizens per occupation.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "citizens": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "citizens"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "occupations": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "citizens.occupation",
            "size": 50
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "took": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 113,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "citizens": {
      "doc_count": 3966,
      "occupations": {
        "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
        "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
        "buckets": [
          {
            "key": "Hairdresser",
            "doc_count": 243
          },
          {
            "key": "Microbiologist",
            "doc_count": 241
          },
          {
            "key": "Farmer",
            "doc_count": 234
          },
          {
            "key": "Marketing Manager",
            "doc_count": 231
          },
          {
            "key": "Clinical Laboratory Technician",
            "doc_count": 230
          },
          {
            "key": "Librarian",
            "doc_count": 230
          },
          {
            "key": "Editor",
            "doc_count": 229
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So, there are *3966* citizens that have registered their pets to our city offices of which 243 are Hairdressers, 241 are Microbiologists etc.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <div class="alert-heading"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Important note</div>
  Mind the field definition of the nested <strong>Terms</strong> aggregation in the query. <strong>It has to be the full path of the nested object</strong>.
</div>

Ok good, but what if wanted to see in how many offices are these citizens registered. In other words, how many offices have Marketing Managers? How many offices have Librarians?

#### Reverse nested aggregations

We have to use another type of aggregation, named [Reverse nested aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-reverse-nested-aggregation.html).

> A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating on parent docs from nested documents. Effectively this aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the root document, which allows nesting other aggregations that arenâ€™t part of the nested object in a nested aggregation.
>
> The reverse_nested aggregation must be defined inside a nested aggregation.
> <cite>--[official Elasticsearch Reverse nested aggregation reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-reverse-nested-aggregation.html)</cite>

Even though it might sound complicated, it's not. And playing around with the data is the best way for understanding the provided functionality of any feature.

Syntax:
```json
GET <index_name>/_search
{

  "aggs" : {
    "<aggregation-name>" : {
      "nested" : {
        "path" : "<nested-object-path>"
      },
      "aggs" : {
        "<nested-aggregation-name>": {
          "<aggregation-type>" : { <aggregation-properties> },
          "aggs": {
            "in_offices": {
              "reverse_nested": { <reverse-nested-options> }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the reverse nested aggregation is always defined as a sub-aggregation inside a nested aggregation.

Time to see **in how many offices** each occupation is spread.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "citizens": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "citizens"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "occupations": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "citizens.occupation",
            "size": 50
          },
          "aggs": {
            "in_offices": {
              "reverse_nested": {}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

            "in_offices": {

            }
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Translating the response, we have 243 Hairdressers registered in 98 offices, 241 Microbiologists registered in 98 offices, 234 Farmers registered in 99 offices etc.

The reverse nested aggregation accepts a single option named **`path`**. This options defines how many steps backwards in the document hierarchy we want Elasticsearch to go to calculate the aggregations. In our case, since `citizens` is the immediate relation of the city office type we had to leave it undefined implying that we want the aggregations of the occupations to be calculated against the root object a.k.a. the offices. Confused? Don't worry, it will become clear after playing around with the pets. Now.

**How many pets per kind are registered per citizen?**

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "citizens": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "citizens.pets"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "kinds": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "citizens.pets.kind",
            "size": 10
          },
          "aggs": {
            "per_citizen": {
              "reverse_nested": {}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that we didn't define the `path` option and <i class="fa fa-play text-success icon-in-text"></i>

            "key": "Dog",

            "per_citizen": {
              "doc_count": 113
            }
          },
          {
            "key": "Hamster",

            }
          },
          {
            "key": "Cat",
            "doc_count": 2380,
            "per_citizen": {
              "doc_count": 113
            }
          },
          {
            "key": "Bird",
            "doc_count": 2330,
            "per_citizen": {
              "doc_count": 113
            }

            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So, there are 2421 registered dogs, 2403 registered hamsters, 2380 registered cats etc. The `per_citizen` bucket info though doesn't seem right. Does the `113` number ring a bell? Exactly, that's how many offices we have. **Since we didn't define the `path` in the reverse nested aggregation, Elasticsearch calculated the count of root documents (a.k.a. the offices) that have each pet kind registered**. Let's fix that.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "citizens": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "citizens.pets"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "kinds": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "citizens.pets.kind",
            "size": 10
          },
          "aggs": {
            "per_citizen": {
              "reverse_nested": {
                "path": "citizens"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There it is:

```json

    }
  }
}
```

There are 2421 dogs registered by 1864 citizens, 2403 hamsters registered by 1852 citizens, 2380 cats registered by 1823 citizens etc.

**Note**: Each citizen has more than one pets which can be of different kind that's why the `per_citizen` sum of *doc_count* is way bigger than our citizens.

Before moving on to the last type of aggregations, let's execute a more advanced nested query answering to the questions:

**For each city, how many kind of pets are registered per citizen occupation and in how many offices?**

Breaking down the question, we have to think like this:

- Since we want results per city, we are going to add a Terms aggregation on the field `city`
- Since we want to have results per citizen occupation, we are going to add a Terms sub-aggregation on the field `occupation`.
  - Since the citizen is a nested object, the aggregation of the previous item has to be a sub-aggregation of a Nested aggregation on the path `citizen`
- Since we want to have results per pet kind, we are going to add a Terms sub-aggregation on the field `kind`.
  - Since the pet is a nested object, the aggregation of the previous item has to be a sub-aggregation of a Nested aggregation on the path `citizen.pets`

        },
        ...
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

"Human" reading the response, in Amsterdam there are 8 offices with 230 citizens that have registered pets of which:
- 19 are Dancers that have registered a total of 49 pets of which
  - 13 are cats registered by 9 dancers in 5 offices
  - 11 are rabbits registered by 10 dancers in 5 offices
  - ...
  - 8 are hamsters registered by 7 dancers in 3 offices
  - I stop this now because I got dizzy

### Global aggregations

I will end this tutorial with something easier. [Global aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-global-aggregation.html).

> Defines a single bucket of all the documents within the search execution context. This context is defined by the indices and the document types youâ€™re searching on, but is not influenced by the search query itself.
> <cite>-- [official Elasticsearch Global aggregation reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-global-aggregation.html)</cite>

To better explain this, let's re-think of query:

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      },
      "aggs": {
        "office_types": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "office_type"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "office_types": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "office_type",
        "size": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

which would help us build this form:

<div class="alert alert-secondary mb-5">
  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>Amsterdam (8)</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary (4)
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary (4)
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>London (8)</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary (6)
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary (2)
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>Athens (7)</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary (2)
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary (5)
    </label>
  </div>
</div>

When we render such a form, what is the expected behavior once he/she clicks on a checkbox, for example **London**? Well, we expect the aggregations to be re-applied to the search results that were narrowed by the clicked facet. So the request will become:

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "city": {
        "value": "London"
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      },
      "aggs": {
        "office_types": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "office_type",
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and the response:

```json
{
  "took": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 8,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "cities": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "London",
          "doc_count": 8,
          "office_types": {
            "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
            "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
            "buckets": [
              {
                "key": "primary",
                "doc_count": 6
              },
              {
                "key": "secondary",
                "doc_count": 2
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If we rendered the form based on the response, it would only have the *London entry*:

<div class="alert alert-secondary mb-5">
  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>London (8)</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary (6)
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary (2)
    </label>
  </div>
</div>

It would be better if we could render the previous form with disabled checkboxes for the terms that are no longer valid.

<div class="alert alert-secondary mb-5">
  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_amsterdam_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>Amsterdam</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_amsterdam_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_amsterdam_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" checked type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_1">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>London</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_1">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary (6)
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_1">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary (2)
    </label>
  </div>

  <div class="form-check">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      <strong>Athens</strong>
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Primary
    </label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-check ml-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" disabled type="checkbox" value="" id="city_athens_2">
    <label class="form-check-label">
      Secondary
    </label>
  </div>
</div>

We could accomplish that if we had the aggregation results of a search request without a query and compared them with the search request that was triggered after user narrows the results by clicking on a checkbox. To avoid executing an additional search request, we can use the Global aggregation.

```json
GET city_offices/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "city": {
        "value": "London"
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "cities": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "city",
        "size": 50
      },
      "aggs": {
        "office_types": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "office_type",
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "unfiltered": {
      "global": {},
      "aggs": {
