I wanted to update the icon of this blog (to become what else? a cat) and I didn't remember how I had created the previous one but I do remember I did it via [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

This time though, I found a pretty simple [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) command and it worked like a charm.

```bash
convert <your-image-here> -define icon:auto-resize=256,64,48,32,16 favicon.ico
```

[Here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php) are all the available options for the **imagemagick** `convert` command.
